Better than words will be better having a look at the .html file

And here is a small description of the project:
Written in Python notebook, I retrived some 'ynet' articles regarding a country as input from user. 
Using web scrapping to get the details for every article.
Later I collected some "intelligence" from web about the country, like the flag image and how the people in the country sing their national anthem (anthem's lyrics)
